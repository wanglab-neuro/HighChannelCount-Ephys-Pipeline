description: |-
  Electrophysiology analysis pipeline using Kilosort2.5 via SpikeInterface.

  The pipeline includes:

  - preprocessing: phase_shift, highpass filter, denoising (bad channel removal + common median reference ("cmr") or highpass spatial filter - "destripe"), and motion estimation (optionally correction)
  - spike sorting: with Kilosort2.5
  - postprocessing: remove duplicate units, compute amplitudes, spike/unit locations, PCA, correlograms, template similarity, template metrics, and quality metrics
  - curation: based on ISI violation ratio, presence ratio, and amplitude cutoff and unit labeling (noise, MUA, SUA) based on pre-trained classifier (UnitRefine)
  - visualization: timeseries, drift maps, and sorting output in sortingview
  - export session, subject, and units data to NWB
